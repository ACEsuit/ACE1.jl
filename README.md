**WARNING:** This package now acts mostly as a (to be retired) backend to other packages. If you have come to this repository to fit interatomic potentials, then please go to the user-facing companion package [`ACEpotentials.jl`](https://github.com/ACEsuit/ACEpotentials.jl) which also provides documentation and tutorials on the usage of `ACE1.jl`.

---

This package implements a flavour of the *Atomic Cluster Expansion*; i.e., parameterisation schemes for permutation and isometry invariant functions, primarily for the purpose of modelling invariant atomic properties. It provides constructions of symmetric polynomial bases, imposing permutation and isometry invariance.
